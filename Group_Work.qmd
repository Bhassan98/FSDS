## 1. Who collected the data?

::: {.duedate}

( 2 points; Answer due Week 7 )

The data was collected by @insideairbnb which is a investigatory website with a mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities. The data on the site is sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site, which is then analysed, cleansed, and aggregated to facilitate public discussion. The founder Murray Cox, is a community artist and hactivist utilising technology as a means of social change. 


## 2. Why did they collect it?

@insideairbnb collected the data for several key reasons: 
1. To highlight illegal renting and gentrification - highlight the financialisation of housing as speculative assets
2. To facilitate public discussion and awareness -inform public of impact of STL properties
3. To use data for social change - influencing public policy
4. To provide accessible data analysis - so anyone can understand its impact

```

## 3. How was the data collected?  

Source Code and Technology: The data is scraped from the Airbnb website ("https://zh.airbnb.com") using Python, and the results are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Each data collection for a city is referred to as a "survey".  Part of the Python codes they use can be found from the url "https://github.com/tomslee/airbnb-data-collection" (Abdulkareem Alsudais, 2021). And also they may used a tool called import.io, whose website is "https://www.import.io/products" to extract the data

Data Collection Details: The scraping script collects various data points for each Airbnb listing, including host ID, room type, country, city, neighborhood, address, number of reviews, overall satisfaction rating, accommodation details (like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms), price, minimum stay, last modified timestamp, latitude, longitude, and survey ID. Notably, certain data like occupancy rates, host income, specific addresses, and guest information are not collected

Accuracy and Limitations: The methodology aims for a high degree of accuracy, typically within 10% to 20% of the actual number of listings. The process does not use "trip dates" in searches, which means listings marked as unavailable are not excluded. There can be challenges in ensuring the accuracy of location data and neighborhood boundaries, and sometimes listings outside city boundaries are included. Despite these challenges, the data is generally considered reliable for policy and social impact discussions

Unavailable Data: Some data is not collected or available through these surveys, including occupancy rates, host income, specific addresses, and guest information​​

## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data raise? 

When considering ethical considerations in using data from the Inside Airbnb website, the following seven aspects are crucial:

1. User Privacy and Data Security: The data contains precise geographical locations of Airbnb listings. While using this data, it's essential to ensure that personal privacy is not compromised and to comply with relevant data protection laws and standards.

2. Original Data Accuracy and Reliability: Murray Cox, in his study "How Airbnb’s data hid the facts in New York City," highlighted that Data Manipulation Before Public Release can significantly affect data integrity and accuracy, raising broader issues about data transparency and operability. This indicates a clear bias in data research. While the report mentions only New York City's data being explicitly altered, London's Airbnb data might still be accurate and reliable, but this requires further substantiation.

3. Secondary Interpretation or Modification of Data: After scraping data from Airbnb, the website creator, Murray Cox, processed and filtered the data, which could introduce bias. If the original data or its processing is biased or flawed, these issues might be magnified in secondary references. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the data's original sources, processing methods, and potential limitations is necessary. There might be interpretations or modifications by the website creator to the original dataset, leading to misleading analysis outcomes. Potential information biases should be considered when using the data.

4. Data Sharing and Reuse: Correct citation of data sources is crucial in academic research. When referencing website data, it's important to correctly cite both the original data sources and the processors to maintain academic integrity. Additionally, we need to ensure data use aligns with company promises.

5. Consistency of Research Purpose with Data Collection: Inside Airbnb's original data might have been collected and processed to better develop Airbnb and local communities. When the data is used for different study and research purposes, it might deviate from the original intent, raising ethical issues, especially if the new usage of data is inconsistent with the expectations and consent of the data subjects. Therefore, our research scope/purpose and methods have undergone strict ethical considerations, ultimately aimed at providing data support for improving residents' environment and Airbnb's business practices.

6. Impact on Public Interest: Research on Airbnb data can potentially impact the community and public interest. The public disclosure of specific location data and housing prices can affect nearby tenants, Airbnb operators, and regional public interests. For example, a high density of Airbnb listings in certain areas might affect the long-term rental market due to disturbance or tenant safety concerns, negatively impacting the community environment and resident satisfaction.

7. Potential Discrimination and Bias: The application of the data is based on the distribution of London Boroughs, including factors like housing prices, which may create or exacerbate stereotypes against specific groups. For instance, market data analysis of Airbnb should not lead to adverse effects on low-income areas or specific racial communities. Analytical results should not intensify social inequalities, such as unfair treatment of listings or hosts in certain areas based on data analysis results.

## 6. With reference to the data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and Listing types suggest about the nature of Airbnb lets in London? 

::: {.duedate}

According to statistics on Airbnb listings, there are a total of 53,395 hosts for Airbnb properties  in London, which can be broadly categorized into four types: 
a.individual hosts, who, as homeowners, may reside in the listed house or apartment.
b.professional hosts, who are generally investors, buying property specifically for short-term lease to obtain a stable rental income. 
c.listing management teams, companies or groups that oversee listings on behalf of property owners. Veeve, for instance, serves as a residential platform for visitors, facilitating homeowners in renting out their properties.
d.hoteliers, who put some listings on the Airbnb platform to attract online bookings

As a result, Airbnb hosts in London exhibit a diverse range of characteristics, contributing to the diversity of room type.

The analysis of Airbnb listings indicates that a host may choose to list separate rooms within the same apartment or offer multiple apartments or homes for rent in their entirety.

Hosts with multiple listings are more likely to be professional hosts, listing management teams or hotels. Their properties are generally dispersed across various geographical locations and are commonly situated in proximity to downtown areas.

Airbnb hosts in London are primarily individual hosts, yet the presence of more professional landlords should not be overlooked. Among them, 1,389 hosts manage more than five listings, totaling 22,647 listings and constituting approximately 25.8 percent of all properties. Notably, STK Homes leads with the highest number of listings at 595.
Airbnb listing room types in London are dominated by Entire home/apt(62.1%) and Private room(37.2%). In addition, there are a small number of Shared room and Hotel room.

In central London ntire home/apt accounts for a large proportion of all listings, which is contrary to the rule of Private room. In most parts of London, Entire home/apt is the main room type, except for a few boroughs on the edge of the city. This may be due to the more Entire home/apt listings in central London because these areas may have more apartments and listings for rent. In the suburbs or other areas, independent houses may be more common, and hosts prefer to use some of them for rent, such as renting private rooms.

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (e.g. figures, maps, and statistical analysis/models), how *could* this data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?
