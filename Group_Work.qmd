## 1. Who collected the data?

::: {.duedate}

( 2 points; Answer due Week 7 )

The data was collected by @insideairbnb which is a investigatory website with a mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities. The data on the site is sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site, which is then analysed, cleansed, and aggregated to facilitate public discussion. The founder Murray Cox, is a community artist and hactivist utilising technology as a means of social change. 


## 2. Why did they collect it?

@insideairbnb collected the data for several key reasons: 
1. To highlight illegal renting and gentrification - highlight the financialisation of housing as speculative assets
2. To facilitate public discussion and awareness -inform public of impact of STL properties
3. To use data for social change - influencing public policy
4. To provide accessible data analysis - so anyone can understand its impact

```{python}
print(f"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]:,}")
```

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the data collected?  

Source Code and Technology: The data is scraped from the Airbnb website ("https://zh.airbnb.com") using Python, and the results are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Each data collection for a city is referred to as a "survey".  Part of the Python codes they use can be found from the url "https://github.com/tomslee/airbnb-data-collection" (Abdulkareem Alsudais, 2021). And also they may used a tool called import.io, whose website is "https://www.import.io/products" to extract the data

Data Collection Details: The scraping script collects various data points for each Airbnb listing, including host ID, room type, country, city, neighborhood, address, number of reviews, overall satisfaction rating, accommodation details (like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms), price, minimum stay, last modified timestamp, latitude, longitude, and survey ID. Notably, certain data like occupancy rates, host income, specific addresses, and guest information are not collected

Accuracy and Limitations: The methodology aims for a high degree of accuracy, typically within 10% to 20% of the actual number of listings. The process does not use "trip dates" in searches, which means listings marked as unavailable are not excluded. There can be challenges in ensuring the accuracy of location data and neighborhood boundaries, and sometimes listings outside city boundaries are included. Despite these challenges, the data is generally considered reliable for policy and social impact discussions

Unavailable Data: Some data is not collected or available through these surveys, including occupancy rates, host income, specific addresses, and guest information​​
